In my scientific article on laryngoscopes' light https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bjane.2016.07.007 I utilized an Android device to measure the illuminance of laryngoscopes and compared it to a certified light meter.

To minimize biases as much as possible, I required an Android application that could obtain illuminance readings from the Android device's light sensor in its rawest form. This application needed to be lightweight, utilizing minimal system resources, and accessing the sensor at the lowest possible level.

To fulfill this requirement, I decided to develop my own code so that I could access the source code and make any necessary modifications.

This repository represents the final outcome of my Android application.

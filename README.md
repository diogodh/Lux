In my scientific article on laryngoscopes' light https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bjane.2016.07.007 I used and Android device to measure the laryngoscopes' illuminance and compare it to a certified light meter.

To eliminate as many biases as possible I needed an Android application that could retrieve illuminance from the Android device light sensor as raw as possible, in an Application using the lowest resources possible and to access the sensor at the lowest possible level.

In order to do fulfill this task, the best way was for me to code it, so I could access the source code and do modifications if needed.

This repo is the final result of my Android App.
